# VLAN and Trunking Lab (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This is a beginner-friendly Cisco Packet Tracer project focused on understanding the basic concepts of **VLANs** and **trunking** in a network environment.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Created and assigned **4 VLANs** on a Layer 2 switch.
- Assigned multiple switch ports to different VLANs.
- Introduced the concept of **inter-VLAN communication** (though not yet configured).
- Set up trunk links in preparation for communication between switches or with a router.

> ⚠️ Note: Inter-VLAN communication has **not yet been configured**, so devices in separate VLANs cannot communicate at this stage.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand how to segment a network using VLANs.
- Get hands-on practice assigning ports to VLANs.
- Learn about trunk ports and their role in VLAN traffic tagging.
- Recognize the need for a Layer 3 device (like a router or Layer 3 switch) for inter-VLAN routing.

## 📁 File

- `activity1.pkt` – Packet Tracer file for this project.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file using [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/portal/resources/packet-tracer).
2. Explore the VLAN setup on the switch.
3. Try configuring trunk ports or adding a router-on-a-stick setup to enable inter-VLAN routing.
